               Final project
In this project I study the dataset that contains information about suicide rate for each age 
and gender group for countries from 1985-2016. It also includes information about population, human 
development index, GDP, GDP per Capita for each year. I use Python to extract list of countries and
generations from the dataset. Further, I study the association of variables with suicide rate using
Stata. I download and merge Literacy rate of countries for the given years in order to include this 
variable to the OLS analyses


To re-do the analyses
-Make Final-project as working directory in both Stata and Jupyter lab;
-Run master.do file in Stata;
-Run project Jupyter notebook in Python using Jupyter lab;
